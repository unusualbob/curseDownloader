# curseDownloader
Automatically downloads all mod dependencies for a given curse project manifest.json. I made this because I didn't want to make a curse account and run their client, and [the python version made by portablejim](https://github.com/portablejim/curseDownloader) didn't work for me.

#Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

# Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:unusualbob/curseDownloader.git
cd curseDownloader
npm install
```
# Usage
```
node dl.js /path/to/mod/manifest.json
```
